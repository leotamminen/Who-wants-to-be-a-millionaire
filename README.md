# Who Wants to Be an Engineer

## Overview

This is a group project for the University of Turku course "DTEK2074 Information Technology Labs". The project features a quiz game inspired by "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", with the frontend built using React.
Working version of the game is deployed to Vercel and can be played [here](https://who-wants-to-be-an-engineer.vercel.app/)
Keep in mind that the current version is still under development and there are can be (and are) unhandled errors.

## Project Status

The project is currently at an early stage of development. It consists of two main branches:

- **master**: This branch contains the stable version of the project.
- **dev**: Development work is done on this branch. Changes are made here and then merged into master once they are working properly.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a quiz game using the MERN stack and deploy it to Vercel. The game will be fully functional and feature AI-generated questions. The backup questions are stored in a MongoDB database. These backup questions serve as a fail-safe option in case of any issues with the AI generation process.
